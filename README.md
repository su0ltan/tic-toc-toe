# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
# Tic Tac Toe

Welcome to Tic Tac Toe, a classic game built using React and Vite template!

## Overview
This project is my first React development, where I aimed to create a simple Tic Tac Toe game. Through this project, I familiarized myself with React's component-based architecture, state management, and the overall development workflow using Vite as a build tool.
